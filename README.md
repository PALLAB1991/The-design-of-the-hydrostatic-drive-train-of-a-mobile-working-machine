# The-design-of-the-hydrostatic-drive-train-of-a-mobile-working-machine
Hydrostatic drive chain is a closed hydraulic circuit which generally consists of a hydraulic pump  which is driven by a diesel engine, a motor which produces a torque. In our project we also used  an auxiliary pump. We observe the variation of change in nature between the displacement of  pump and motor and velocity with force. It is observed when the vehicle start to move from point  1 to point 2. Initially it has a full displacement of motor but the displacement of pump is zero with  corresponds to maximum force at almost zero velocity as the vehicle starts to move there is an  exponential drop in force with increase in velocity and we observe the displacement of pump  also increases at a certain point say 3 the motor and pump has a maximum displacement and  after that displacement of motor decrease exponentially. We tally our calculated result with the  Simulink model provided to us.
